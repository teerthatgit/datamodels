# MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source database management system, however there are also commercial editions of the software that are available. 
It uses a document-data, NoSQL model (similar to CouchDB).
MongoDB also supports multiple different hosting models including embedded, local, cloud, client/server, and hybrid.
MongoDB also supports multiple different languages, including Python and Java.
To specifically connect using Java, one would need to integrate using the MongoDB Java Driver.
To specifically connect using Python, one would need to integrate using PyMongo or Motor Drivers.
