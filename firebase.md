# Firebase

Firebase is a mostly commercial database management system, however there are also some free features. 
It uses a document-data, NoSQL model.
Firebase uses a client-server hosting, where one has to use its API to interact with it.
Firebase also supports multiple different languages, including Python and Java.
To connect using either Java or Python, one would need to use it's APIs and SDKs.
