# Apache Cassandra

Cassandra (by the Apache foundation) is an open-source database management system. 
It uses a columnar-data, NoSQL model.
Cassandra also supports multiple different hosting models including embedded, local, cloud, and client/server.
Cassandra also supports multiple different languages, including Python and Java.
To specifically connect using Java, there are multiple options, but one can use the [DataStax Cassandra Java driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).
To specifically connect using Python, one could use the [DataStax Cassandra Python Driver](https://github.com/datastax/python-driver).
