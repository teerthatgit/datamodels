# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system. 
It uses a object-relational data-model, however newer versions also provide support for other models such as key-value and document.
PostgreSQL also supports multiple different hosting models including embedded, local, cloud, client/server, and hybrid.
PostgreSQL also supports multiple different languages, including Python and Java.
To specifically connect using Java, one would need to integrate using the Java JDBC driver for PostgreSQL.
To specifically connect using Python, one would need to integrate using the Psycopg adapter.
