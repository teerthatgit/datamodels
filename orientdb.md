# OrientDB

OrientDB is an open-source database that uses a combination of the graph data-model with the document data-model, thus it is called multi-model.
OrientDB can be hosted on cloud, via client/server, locally, or it can be embedded. OrientDB can be accessed via Java using the JDBC driver as enumerated
in Orient's doc [here](https://orientdb.com/docs/last/jdbc-driver/). In Python, OrientDB can be accessed using PyOrient.
The website for OrientDB is [here](http://orientdb.org/), alternatively the url is: http://orientdb.org/.
